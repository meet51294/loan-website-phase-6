                    <p><strong>Terms & Conditions of Loan Agreement</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>1. Application</strong></p>
                    <p>The Terms and Conditions of this loan will apply to and form part of the Fixed-Sum Agreement
                        (“the Agreement”) entered into by you online with Step Change Limited of Bridge Studios, 34a
                        Deodar Road, London SW15 2NN, Company Registration Number 4519020.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>2. Payment</strong></p>
                    <p>You agree to repay the Total Amount Payable on the promised date. Payment must be made to us at
                        the address stated above or to any other person or address notified by us in writing. Punctual
                        payment is essential. If you pay by post you do so at your own risk. If you mandate payment by
                        debit or credit card [by way of a continuous payment authority] and your payment declines you
                        authorise us to take smaller incremental payments, on or after the mandated payment date, until
                        the total mandated payment is made. You may cancel your continuous payment authority at any
                        time. If you do this you must arrange for another way to repay the amount owed.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>3. Earlier payment by you</strong></p>
                    <p>You have the right to pay off some or all of the debt that you owe us at any time. You must give
                        us notice that you want to do this. If you want to pay off your debt in full, you must tell us
                        the date on which you plan to do this. You can contact us at Step Change Limited, Bridge Studios,
                        34a Deodar Road, London SW15 2NN or by phone on 03304004381 or visit any of our UK stores. If
                        you want to pay off the loan in full, we will send you a settlement figure in writing setting
                        out what you owe. When you make a partial payment, we will first use it to pay any arrears or
                        overdue interest and will then apply the payment to reduce the term of the agreement.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>4. Failure to pay on time</strong></p>
                    <p>We have the right to charge interest at the APR shown on the Pre-Contract Credit Information and
                        the Fixed-Sum Loan Agreement, or at a lower rate of APR as we may deem appropriate, (less that
                        part attributable to any charges other than interest) on all overdue amounts as well as the
                        outstanding balance if not paid by the due date. Interest is charged at a simple fixed interest
                        rate of the percentage stated on the Pre-Contract Credit Information and the Fixed-Sum Loan
                        Agreement per annum on the Amount of Credit for the Term and is applied to the account, in full,
                        at the commencement of this agreement.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>5. Right to demand earlier payment</strong></p>

                        (a) any amount payable by you is overdue for more than 14 days; or<br>
                        (b) any statement made by you in applying for this Loan is found to be untrue; or<br>

                        bankruptcy, or are served with a creditor’s demand under the Insolvency Act 1986, or make a
                        formal composition or scheme with your creditors, or call a meeting of them;<br>
                        We have the right to demand immediate payment of the outstanding balance under this Agreement
                        plus the Interest by sending you a Default Notice under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>6. Expenses</strong></p>
                    <p>You must pay to us on demand our expenses and all legal costs for :<br>

                        (a) No relaxation or indulgence which we may extend to you shall affect our strict rights under

                        rights, including your rights under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. You may not transfer or assign
                        your rights or obligations under this Agreement.
                        <br>
                        (c) Where two or more of you are named as the Borrower you jointly and severally accept the
                        obligations under this Agreement. This means that each of you could be held fully liable for all
                        obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.
                        <br>

                        (e) We may vary or introduce new terms to this Agreement provided that such variations or new
                        terms are reasonable and we give you 30 days written notice.

                        (g) If any part of the Loan Terms & Conditions that is not fundamental is found to be illegal or
                        unenforceable, such finding will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
                        the Loan Terms & Conditions or the Agreement, as the case may be.

                        </strong><br>
                        In considering your application, we will search your record at Credit Reference Agencies. They
                        will add, to their record about you, details of our search and your application and this will be
                        seen by other organisations that make searches. This and other information about you and those
                        with whom you are linked financially may be used to make credit decisions about you and other
                        members of your household.
                        We may use a credit scoring or other automated decision making system when assessing your
                        application.
                        We will also add to your record with the Credit Reference Agencies details of your Agreement
                        with us, any payments you make under it and any default or failure to keep to its terms. These
                        records will be shared with other organisations and may be used and searched by us and them to

                        Fraud prevention agency records will be shared with other organisations to help make decisions
                        on credit, motor, household, life and other insurance proposals or claims, for you and members
                        of your household.
                        We will use personal information about you which we acquire in connection with any application
                        you make to us, or any agreement you enter into with us, to manage your agreement and for
                        statistical or market research purposes.<br><br>
                        Please telephone or write to us at the telephone number/address stated above (see clause 9
                        above) if you want to have details of the credit reference agencies or any other agencies from
                        whom we obtain, and to whom we pass information about you. You have a legal right to these
                        details. You have a right to receive a copy of the information we hold about you if you apply to
                        us in writing. A fee may be payable.

                    <P><strong>USE OF ASSOCIATED RECORDS
                        </strong> <br>
                        We may before entering into this Agreement search records at credit reference agencies which may
                        be linked to your spouse/partner or other person with whom you are linked financially and other
                        members of your household. For the purposes of any application or this agreement you may be
                        treated as financially linked and you will be assessed with reference to “associated” records.
                        <br><br>
                        Where any search or application is completed or this agreement entered into involving joint
                        parties, you both consent to us recording details at credit reference agencies. As a result an
                        “association” will be created which will link your financial records and your associate’s
                        information may be taken into account when a future search is made by us or another lender
                        unless you file a “disassociation” at the credit reference agency.
